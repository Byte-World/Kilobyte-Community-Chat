Book Summary:
Y'Tin started out with him cleaning the elephant early in the morning. Then he went to school and at school, some Vietcog soldiers shot the window out of his classroom. He had asked for his own longhouse next to the elephants, but his father didnt let him so he built his own shack. During his dinner, he smelled cooking elephant meat from another clan and wasnt happy because he was so fond of elephants. After that, he had a private talk with his father about taking the elephants and his family into the forest. He said there was going to be a village meeting the next day. Afterwards, he and some other elephant keepers ran into one of Y'Tin's friends and he promised to teach his friend how to take care of elephants.

Paint.net notes/new knowledge:
-Lasso tool allows you to select certain areas and then make changes to it. This allows you to do things like erase pencil marks on a piece of paper that you wrote on and scanned. That way things like smudges can be removed, then selected with lasso tool, and either deleted, or smudged with the looks of regular paper.
-Editing text to look like it was written in sand. Create a layer with is the text layer with whatever text you want. Use the depress function to change the scatter radius which will then make it look sandy. Then use the splinter function to blur it allowing it to "sit" in sand. Then emboss the text layer whcih basically allows you to embed the text into the background. Then create other layer and do it vise versa around text to make extra sand that is coming out. Change background hue to make it more like sand, change the darkness to change the "wetness" of sand.

Book Summary A Million Shades of Gray:
Y'Tin after having the talk with his father, he found out that he wouldn't have to go to school anymore, which meant taking care of Lady the Elephant full time. He and Y'Siu and Tomas took there elephants into the jungle where they could stay safe and away from the war. Y'Tin didn't have a hard time packing everything and left into the jungle with them. They were all hiding in the jungle because they wanted to avoid the war and the vietcog soldiers. At one point, Y'Tin had to make a trip back to the village to check on everyone when he noticed fresh footprints on the ground. He followed them a bit and started hearing voices, so he went on to the village and found his family safe. He stayed for a bit but then returned to the jungle where most everyone else was.
