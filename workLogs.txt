Book Summary:
Y'Tin started out with him cleaning the elephant early in the morning. Then he went to school and at school, some Vietcog soldiers shot the window out of his classroom. He had asked for his own longhouse next to the elephants, but his father didnt let him so he built his own shack. During his dinner, he smelled cooking elephant meat from another clan and wasnt happy because he was so fond of elephants. After that, he had a private talk with his father about taking the elephants and his family into the forest. He said there was going to be a village meeting the next day. Afterwards, he and some other elephant keepers ran into one of Y'Tin's friends and he promised to teach his friend how to take care of elephants.
